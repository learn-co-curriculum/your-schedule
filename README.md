The Online Data Science full-time program is five months long, and expects you to work 45-50 hours per week. The part-time program is 10 months long, and expects you to work about 25 hours per week. 

## Weekly Curriculum Assignments
Lessons and labs will be released at the start of each module. The expectation is that students complete all of the labs and lessons released by the end of that module. Each module will also have an “Appendix” section - labs and lessons in the Appendix are not required to be completed by the end of the module, but are instead offered as additional content to go beyond the material covered in the core curriculum, if you’d like to.

Weekly progress requirements will be communicated via the Learn homepage (you can click on the Learn icon in the top left corner to access the Learn homepage).

## Weekly Study Groups
Study Groups are a great way to deepen your understanding of a concept as you participate in live discussions with instructors and your peers. Study groups for each cohort will be held weekly, and will cover topics relevant to the lessons and labs assigned that week. For our Full-Time program, hour-long study groups are held 4 days a week during the day. For our Part-Time program, hour-long study groups are held two days a week in the evening. 

In addition to the cohort-based study groups, supplemental study groups will be hosted by additional members of the Online Instructional team. These will vary in day and time from week to week and are optional. For more information about study groups, refer to the Study Groups section below.


## Cohort Calendar
The Google calendar for your cohort will live on your Learn homepage once the course begins (click on the Learn icon at the top left corner of the page to access the Learn homepage). This calendar will be a high level overview of the coming weeks and months and will include dates (and times) for study groups, events, holidays, portfolio project due dates, and anything else that might be important from a time standpoint. You can add this Google calendar to your Google calendar by clicking the “+Google Calendar” button on the bottom right corner of the calendar.

## Scheduled Breaks
Full-Time and Part-Time cohorts have a one-week break in instruction between Modules 2 and 3. Part-Time cohorts also have a one-week break in instruction between Modules 4 and 5. 

During these breaks, there is no formal instruction or study groups.

## Technical Mentorship 
Students will meet weekly with their Cohort Leads - and we ask you to come prepared to these meetings with specific questions in order to make the best use of time. An Instructor meeting can be catered to address your unique challenges each week and can include: 

Discussing a topic/lab you struggled with the past week
* Pairing on lab(s) you are currently working on
* Instructor testing your knowledge on the topics covered that week 
* Planning/supporting your project work during a Project Week
* Identifying additional work to help reinforce topical areas of improvement

## Study Groups
Study Groups are a great way to deepen your understanding of a concept as you participate in live discussions with Instructors and your peers. Live discussion solidifies your understanding of technical topics, as you strengthen your skills to communicate about these new concepts. 

Once your course begins, you can view upcoming study groups here: https://learn.co/study-groups. If you were unable to attend a study group, we record many of those sessions (or sometimes record short video recaps of the material covered in those sessions for easier viewing). For a list of videos, look [here](https://drive.google.com/a/flatironschool.com/open?id=1mdvxw0nZsPScAxyopVvPNPbUF34dzK6otIRgQvQN_Bc). These study group recordings aren’t meant as canonical curriculum - use them as reference points, and if you’re still stuck or can’t find what you need in a video, ask an instructor or a peer to point you towards some more explanatory material.
